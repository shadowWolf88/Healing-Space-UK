- Clear, professional branding and copy (no placeholder text, typos, or lorem ipsum).

- Technical documentation for API, DB schema, and deployment.
- Demo script/guide for presenters (step-by-step showcase flow).

## 6. Testing & Reliability
- All tests passing (pytest, manual smoke tests).
- Backup/restore tested (backups/ folder, DB export/import).
- Error monitoring/logging enabled (console, file, or service).
