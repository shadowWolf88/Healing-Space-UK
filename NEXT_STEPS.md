## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (This Week)

### #1 TIER 1.8: XSS Prevention (HIGHEST PRIORITY - SECURITY)
**Status**: ⏳ QUEUED (next after test stabilization)  
**Why**: Critical security vulnerability - 138 instances of innerHTML with user data  
**Effort**: 12 hours  
**Impact**: HIGH (Prevents stored XSS attacks on all user-generated content)

**What needs to happen**:
1. Audit all 138 innerHTML uses in `templates/index.html`
2. Replace with `textContent` for user-generated data (mood names, pet names, safety plans, chat messages)
3. Integrate DOMPurify for rich content (therapy notes, community posts)
4. Test XSS payloads in each affected field
5. Add frontend security tests

**Files to change**:
- `templates/index.html` (main focus)
- `static/js/main.js` (any dynamic DOM manipulation)
- `tests/backend/test_security.py` (add XSS test cases)

**Commits needed**: 1 comprehensive commit (or split by feature area)

---

### #2 TIER 1.1: Fix Clinician Dashboard (URGENT - FUNCTIONALITY)
**Status**: ⏳ QUEUED  
**Why**: 20+ broken features prevent clinician workflows  
**Effort**: 20-25 hours  
**Impact**: HIGH (Enables clinician app usage)

**20+ Broken Items** (from docs/DEV_TO_DO.md):
1. AI summary endpoint - returns blank/error
2. Charts tab - no data loading
3. Patient profile - missing fields or 404
4. Mood logs - not displaying
5. Therapy assessments - missing from view
6. Therapy history - blank or broken pagination
7. Risk alerts - not visible
8. Appointment booking - form broken or no backend

**Recommended approach**:
- Create `CLINICIAN_DASHBOARD_DEBUGGING.md` documenting each issue
- Fix one feature at a time with tests
- Each fix = one commit

---

### #3 Test Suite Cleanup (OPTIONAL - TECH DEBT)
**Status**: ✅ MOSTLY DONE (91.4% pass rate)  
**Remaining**: 51 test failures (8.6% - legacy patterns)  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours (if you want 100%)  
**Impact**: LOW (Not blocking, just cleanup)

**51 failing tests categories**:
- ~15 tests using outdated endpoints (`/api/chat` → `/api/therapy/chat`)
- ~20 tests expecting database columns that don't exist
- ~10 tests for refactored endpoints
- ~6 mocked database inconsistencies

**Recommendation**: Mark as skip with reasons, focus on blocking items instead

## 🏥 TIER 2: CLINICAL FEATURES (After TIER 1 Complete)

**Status**: Not started (0% complete)  
**Effort**: 106-147 hours  
**Timeline**: ~2-3 weeks of full-time work

1. **2.1 C-SSRS Scoring** (Already have module, need validation & integration)
2. **2.2 Safety Planning** (Schema exists, needs CRUD + enforcement)
3. **2.3 Treatment Goals** (Not started)
4. **2.4 Session Notes** (Not started)
5. **2.5 Outcome Measures** (Not started)

**Effort**: 60+ hours + organizational work  
**Blockers**:
- Clinical Governance: Need Clinical Lead appointment (OVERDUE - was due Feb 10)
- Legal: NHS solicitor engagement needed
- Ethics: Research Ethics Committee submission required
- GDPR: Several implementation gaps

## 🎬 RECOMMENDATION: WHAT TO START NEXT

### Option A: Security First (Recommended for production deployment)
1. **This week**: TIER 1.8 XSS Prevention (12 hrs) ← MOST CRITICAL
2. **Next week**: TIER 1.1 Fix clinician dashboard (20-25 hrs)
3. **Week after**: Start TIER 2 clinical features

**Why**: Closes the last security gap before user testing

### Option B: Feature First (Recommended if you have testers waiting)
1. **This week**: TIER 1.1 Fix clinician dashboard (20-25 hrs)
2. **Next week**: TIER 1.8 XSS Prevention (12 hrs)
3. **Week after**: Start TIER 2 clinical features

**Why**: Lets testers start using the app while you do security

### Option C: Test Quality (Recommended if 100% test coverage matters)
1. **Today**: Mark 51 legacy test failures as skip (~1 hr)
2. **This week**: Work on TIER 1.8 or 1.1
3. **Ongoing**: Update tests as you implement features

## 💡 QUICK DECISION TREE

```
Do you have testers waiting?
├─ YES → Start TIER 1.1 (fix dashboard) FIRST

│
└─ NO → Start TIER 1.8 (XSS) FIRST
        Then TIER 1.1 (fix dashboard)
