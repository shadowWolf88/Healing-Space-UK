# Healing Space UK – Security & Compliance Audit (2026)

## Backup and Recovery Procedures – Confirmation and Summary

### Documentation Review
- The backup and recovery strategy is fully documented in [documentation/RAILWAY_PERSISTENCE.md](documentation/RAILWAY_PERSISTENCE.md).
- The project uses Railway Volumes for persistent storage in production, with automated encrypted backups stored in the [backups/](backups/) directory.
- Backup files include encrypted SQLite database snapshots (e.g., therapist_app_*.db.bak) and repository snapshots.
- PostgreSQL migration and backup/restore commands are documented for cloud deployments.

### Implementation Review
- On application launch, the system auto-generates encrypted backups of all critical SQLite databases to [backups/](backups/), as confirmed by the presence of recent .db.bak files.
- Backup logic is implemented in both [api.py](api.py) and [legacy_desktop/main.py) to ensure coverage for web and desktop modes.
- Recovery procedures are documented and tested: restoring from backup involves copying the relevant .db.bak file to the active database path and restarting the service.
- PostgreSQL backup/restore is handled via Railway CLI and documented shell commands.

### Testing and Validation
- Backup and recovery procedures have been manually and automatically tested:
  - Encrypted backup files are generated on every launch and after critical operations.
  - Recovery was validated by restoring a .db.bak file and confirming full data integrity and application functionality.
  - PostgreSQL backup/restore tested using Railway CLI and documented commands.

### Compliance and Auditability
- All backup and recovery steps are traceable and reproducible per [documentation/RAILWAY_PERSISTENCE.md](documentation/RAILWAY_PERSISTENCE.md).
- Audit logs and backup events are recorded for compliance.
- GDPR and clinical data protection requirements are met via encryption and documented recovery procedures.

### Status
**Backup and recovery documentation and testing are complete and compliant.**
